# Clustering U.S. Small Business Owners

This project uses machine learning to explore and segment small business owners in the United States based on key demographic and financial characteristics. The goal is to uncover hidden patterns and subgroups that can inform business support, policy, and strategic decision-making.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

In this analysis, we:

- Explored the dataset to examine key variables such as:
  - Age  
  - Income Category  
  - Debt vs. Home Value  
- Selected **high-variance features** to use as inputs for the model
- Applied **clustering techniques** to divide business owners into meaningful subgroups
- Visualized the resulting clusters to highlight demographic and financial distinctions

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- [Optional] Streamlit (if integrated into a web app)
- Git & GitHub

## ðŸ“Š Key Features

- **Feature Selection**: Focused on variance to maximize clustering quality  
- **Unsupervised Learning**: KMeans or other clustering algorithms  
- **Visualization**: Clear comparisons across clusters to show differences in characteristics  
- **Insights**: Interpretation of each subgroup to understand their profile and potential needs
